# WealthGlitch Security Guide

This document provides security best practices for researching wallet interaction patterns using the WealthGlitch token contract.

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- **Private Key Security**: Never share or expose the private key of any wallet used in testing
- **Multiple Wallet Setup**: Use separate wallets for deployment, triggering, and receiving funds
- **Network Selection**: Always begin testing on testnets before mainnet research

### Contract Deployment

- **Test Contract First**: Deploy on local networks (Hardhat/Ganache) before public testnets
- **Gas Considerations**: Set appropriate gas prices and limits during deployment
- **Function Visibility**: Ensure only the intended functions are publicly accessible

### Operational Security

- **Activation Management**: Keep the contract deactivated when not actively researching
- **Small Value Testing**: Start with small token amounts before scaling up
- **Monitor Transactions**: Use block explorers to verify all transactions

## Best Practices for Research

### Setup Phase

1. Create dedicated research wallets with clear separation from personal funds
2. Fund the wallets with only the necessary amount for research
3. Deploy the contract with a temporary destination address for initial testing
4. Verify the contract deployment and token minting

### Testing Phase

1. Configure the token transfer list with test tokens first
2. Activate the contract only when ready to test
3. Send the trigger token from a separate wallet
4. Verify all transfers completed as expected
5. Deactivate the contract immediately after testing

### Analysis Phase

1. Verify all transactions on block explorers
2. Document observed behavior and any unexpected results
3. Check gas usage and optimize if necessary
4. Analyze contract interactions from the blockchain perspective

## Preventing Unintended Consequences

### Common Pitfalls

- **Unrecoverable Funds**: Always verify destination addresses before deployment
- **Incomplete Token Lists**: Ensure all relevant tokens are added to the transfer list
- **Gas Limitations**: Be aware of gas limits when transferring multiple tokens
- **Reentrancy Risks**: The contract uses SafeERC20 to prevent reentrancy attacks

### Contingency Planning

1. Have a backup plan for any unintended behaviors
2. Deploy with an emergency deactivation method
3. Test the deactivation functionality before full deployment
4. Keep track of all contract interactions

## Research Ethics

As a researcher, always adhere to these ethical principles:

1. Only research with wallets you fully own and control
2. Document your findings for educational purposes
3. Report any discovered vulnerabilities responsibly
4. Maintain transparency about the nature of your research

## Advanced Security Techniques

For those conducting in-depth security research:

1. **Contract Auditing**: Run static analysis tools on the contract code
2. **Fuzz Testing**: Use tools like Echidna to find edge cases
3. **Bytecode Analysis**: Verify the deployed bytecode matches expectations
4. **Gas Optimization**: Monitor gas consumption for each operation

By following these guidelines, you can conduct effective and secure research on wallet interaction patterns using the WealthGlitch contract.
